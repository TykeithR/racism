        The typical story about race in the u.s. lays out some of the struggles, but without fully explaining the causes particulary the racist police and actions of the u.s. government. " they like 
        trump ain't feeling us, cops still killing us " - meek mill. these quote means a-lot beacause, cops will try to plant evidence and blame it on the person and the cops will get fired or suspended but 
        trump isn't taking the matter serious. He had a strong input on the charlottesvilles situation but he claims he's not racist but his actions and his " tweets " shows that he is.
