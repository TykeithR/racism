      What is Institutionalized Racism?

        <p>
          The Oxford Dictionary definition of institutionalized racism is racial discrimination that has become established 
          as normal behaviour within a society or organization. Institutionalized racism is a major problem in American 
          society. There are clear injustices happening in America, however we tend to turn a blind eye to them. 
          Predominantly, racism occurs in the justice system and education.

          Policies that are made to slight minorities are made and enforced everyday. For example, New York's Stop and Frisk
          policy is heavily unfavorable to minorites. From 2003 to 2016, African-Americans and Latinos counted for about 
          85 percent of the Stop and Frisk searches in New York City. In this timeframe, the number of searches peaked at 
          685,724 in 2011, however the number of searches has been going down since then. There were only 12,404 searches 
          in 2016. However, the percent of stops by race has still been heavily skewed against minorities. In 2013, District
          Judge Shira A. Scheindlin In 2016, 
          African-Americans and Latinos still accounted for 81 percent of stops.

        Only recently in American history have minorities had the same rights to an education as their white counterparts. 
        The Brown v. Board of Education case was only 60 years ago. That's less than one lifetime ago. 
        Minorities have had limited access to higher education in the form of colleges and universities. 
        Historically Black Colleges and Universities, such as Howard University and Morehouse College, have helped the black community get 
        equal access to higher education. However, the problem doesn't end with equal access. In 2015, there were 146 reported cases of racial harassment on 
        college campuses. This number is not a true portrayal of the amount of racial harassment that takes places on college campuses because not
        all cases get reported. The Higher Education Research Institute of UCLA estimated that only 13% of racial incidents at colleges get reported.
        That means tthere is a potential 977 cases that went unreported in 2015. Policies and acts, such as affirmative action and Title VII of the 
        Civil Rights Act of 1964 have helped minorities gain equal footing in a society driven by money.
